# Tim's Heater Usecase

My house is very drafty. I have two heater networks, one in my living room/office and one in my kitchen/bedroom/bathroom. But the sensors for temperature are in my bedroom and living room, and not in the most "representative" areas in the house.

I want a network of sensors around the house that detects the temperature in different rooms, at a higher granularity than my two thermostats.

I can use a T2 to replace the two thermostats and trigger the heater according to a smarter algorithm.

Ideally, I can churn this through DeepMind running on a server to pick an optimum heating cycle for my entire house, similar to what [Google did in their datacenters](http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/21/12246258/google-deepmind-ai-data-center-cooling).
