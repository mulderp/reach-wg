Reach First Meeting
2017-02-05

**Attendance:**

* Kas @nodebotanist
* Patrick @patrickm
* Nick @hipsterbrown
* Kelsey @frijol
* Jia @jia
* Jon @jonmckay
* Tim @tcr

### Agenda

* Introductions!
* [Reach RFC](https://github.com/tessel/rfcs/pull/4) and [earlier proposal](https://github.com/tessel/project/issues/142)
* Where work & documentation is being done
* Software Methodology & Timeline
* Hardware Methodology & Timeline
* Open Hack Time

**ESP32**

- Using the ESP-IDF toolchain for development
- ESP32-DevKitC is the dev kit recently released, Nick has one

**Power Draw & Architecture:**

- Reach has requirements for low-power usage which we'll need to work out early
- If we want "last for months on a coin cell", we're going to have different requirements than "lasts for several days on a LiPo battery"
- We should be open to considering other chipsets: ESP32 might have high power draw for low-power BLE applications
- Nordic nRF51822 and Dialog devices would be the low-power end of this spectrum

**Reach Platform:**

- We could consider Reach as a binary for several platforms
- Work on the ESP32 can be re-invested into work on lower power radios; we'll continue to use this as our development platform for now since everyone has Hardware
- We *will* be moving forward with developing hardware in the meantime
- Next meeting should address hardware platform of choice

**Team Breakdown:**

To move forward on decision making, we'll break the project down into three components:

* Interaction
* Firmware
* Software

To determine requiremnets:

- Kas suggests doing a proper engineering tradeoffs list with weights to address this
- This includes weighting each tradeoff of different platforms
- Created reach-wg repo to organize information (closed old issues/rfc for now)

### Action Items

- @nodebotanist: Produce numbers on ESP32 BLE low power draw
- @nodebotanist: Upload project notes to reach-wg (see Issues)
- @hipsterbrown: Get blinky running on board ESP32 DevKit
- @frijol: Add stuff from Google Drive as archived info to reach-wg
- @tcr: Prepare next meeting and fill out README for reach-wg
